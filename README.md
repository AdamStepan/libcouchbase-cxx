# Couchbase++ - C++ Wrappers for [libcouchbase](https://github.com/couchbase/libcouchbase)

This file contains header-only C++ wrappers for libcouchbase. It is a work
in progress.

Production applications should use the raw C API which is stable. If you're
feeling adventurous and/or would like to help out with creating an idiomatic
C++ API for libcouchbase, feel free to contribute and use.

An example can be found in the top-level source directory.

Use of this library requires that _libcouchbase_ (The C library) be installed.
